                    INFO: When it comes to printing, there are many types of costs included and it is likely that we might skip something. This is where Additional price comes in. Set an amount here for expenses that were otherwise not covered in the rest of the options.

                Example:<br>
                Additional Price is set as $2.50 in inkXE Admin. When your customer customize the product then extra $2.50 will be added to the total printing cost.<br>
