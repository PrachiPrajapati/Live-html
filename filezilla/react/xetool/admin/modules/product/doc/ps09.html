                    INFO: The cost of printing on a bigger size product (XXL, XXXL, 4XL, 5XL) will be certainly higher as compared to printing on smaller sizes (S, M, L). However, companies tend to ignore this and keep the product price same for all sizes, which might incur losses. This feature allows you to compensate for that loss.
