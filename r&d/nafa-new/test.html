                      to meet new challenges at this pivotal point in our journey.”</h3>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">“Creativity,” the pioneering French artist Henri Matisse famously said, “takes courage”.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">   At its core, creativity can be characterised as changing the status quo, going against the grain—which demands compassionate leadership and bold aptitude. This is exemplified in our Founding Principal Mr Lim Hak Tai and his fellow pioneer artists’ journey in 1938, where they valiantly built their vision of a dynamic, vibrant arts institution that is Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA). In the same vein, the academy has been and continues to boldly explore the future, while remaining steadfast in our mission to inspire learning and growth through the arts.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">This Year in Review (YIR) is an excellent opportunity
                   for us to reflect on the extraordinary achievements of the past year, and to renew our commitment in
                   enriching the lives of our students and communities through our exciting brand refresh. As we embark
                   on the academy’s dynamic transformation, it is crucial that we embrace radical new ways to strengthen
                   existing offerings, particularly through mutually beneficial relationships and partnerships in
                   Singapore and across the globe.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">Our landmark partnership with the eminent University of
                   the Arts London (UAL) took off in August 2021 and we were delighted to welcome the pioneer batch of
                   students enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Fine Art, Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Design
                   Practice, and Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Performance Making programmes. In April 2022, NAFA marked a
                   momentous milestone with the Royal College of Music (RCM) London to commemorate 10 years of
                   partnership for the Bachelor of Music (Honours) programme with a celebratory concert. Over the span of
                   a decade, both institutions have elevated classical musicianship from both western and eastern
                   influences to the highest level, benefiting more than 200 graduates in the process. The concert
                   received tremendous positive feedback for the performances from NAFA students and alumni, and the
                   repertoire which included an exclusive composition <i>TEN ON (Variations and Interruptions for 10
                   Players)</i> by Professor William Mival, former Head of Composition at RCM. </p>
                <div class="more-msg-blk">
                   <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">NAFA also established several collaborative projects
                      with key industry partners such as National Parks Board, M1, and National Museum of Singapore,
                      expanding the opportunities to co-develop and co-nurture the next generation of talents and propel
                      them towards fruitful careers. Additionally, our educators are readily pushing boundaries and
                      refreshing existing pedagogies as evinced in the collaboration with the University of Otago (Otago)
                      for the publication led by Dr Rebecca Kan from NAFA, and Associate Professor Joyce Koh Hwee Ling
                      from
                      Otago, <i>Teaching and Learning the Arts in Higher Education with Technology: Vignettes from Practice,</i>
                      where they delved into evolving teaching methods and effects, and provided stimulus for our staff
                      to
                      continue reinvigorating the classroom.</p>
                   <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">The outcome of effective teaching pedagogies is
                      further
                      reflected in our student achievers as they clinched prizes in prominent competitions such as the
                      Nippon Paint Asia Young Designer Awards 2021/2022, The Crowbar Awards 2021, SPADE Awards 2021, and
                      the
                      Marina Bay Sands Countdown 2022 Share the Moment Competition. Embodied with the NAFA spirit of
                      creativity, exploration, and resilience, our students continue to scale heights and position the
                      academy at the forefront of arts education. We are indeed proud of them. </p>
                   <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">Any journey worth taking, will have its fair share of
                      ups and downs. Nevertheless, I am inspired by Matisse’s courage and creativity in the face of
                      challenges as he was unyielding in his pursuit of artmaking despite losing his mobility in his
                      later
                      years. The NAFA community is similarly inspired and encouraged by the determination and passion for
                      the arts by the members of ART:DIS—Singapore’s only arts charity for persons with disabilities.
                      Partnering with the organisation has opened our community’s perceptions while reminding us to
                      anchor
                      NAFA’s values of care and passion in every aspect of our lives. Likewise, I encourage our community
                      to
                      always think about how we can bring more meaning to our endeavours.</p>
                   <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">Here at NAFA, we must capitalise on the incredible

With the spirit of creativity, exploration and resilience, we continue to inspire current and future generations of artists by pushing the boundaries of learning, collaborating and creating. Technology remains a significant feature and an essential enabler of our endeavours to find new ways of expression, as well as to bring artists together to foster discourse, and to advance learning and collaboration.</p>
             <p class="large wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">In 2021, we celebrate the resilience and achievements of our faculty, students, staff, and that of artists across the region. We will forge ahead with the courage to create positive change on an ever-evolving path to success.</p>

             <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">On 10 September 2021, we celebrated the achievements and commencement of a new journey for 962 graduands
                from NAFA's 18 diploma and nine degree courses. This is the academy’s largest graduating cohort to date.
                Hallmark awards such as the Embassy of Peru Award, The Ngee Ann Kongsi Gold Medal and the Wu Tsung Kan
                Book Prizes were presented to outstanding graduands. Alumnus Yeo Yeok Chuan was presented with the NAFA
                Distinguished Alumni Medal in recognition of his achievements in design and for giving back to NAFA.</p>
             <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">Due to prevailing pandemic restrictions, the ceremony was held virtually for the second time, giving the
                families and friends of our graduates the opportunity to celebrate this momentous milestone together. The
                effort reflected NAFA’s future-readiness as a premier, progressive and leading arts institution and more
                importantly, signified a new chapter of growth as NAFA graduates look to chart new paths and make their mark
                as changemakers of tomorrow.</p>
             <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">To date, over 16,000 individuals have graduated from NAFA. Many have gone on to contribute to the arts
                and creative landscape at home and abroad, garnering numerous accolades and awards as the academy moves
                towards a brighter future.</p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">The Sunburst Youth Camp is a key initiative of the STEP Endowment supported by Temasek Foundation. For the second time, NAFA hosted the camp which brought together youths across Asia to Singapore for a dynamic programme. In 2021, the camp aimed to foster the sharing of cultural diversity through dance, music and the arts, as well as the learning of Asian cultures through intercultural projects and activities. </p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">In view of the pandemic, the camp blended physical and online interactions and participants were able to forge meaningful friendships and create memorable artworks based on the theme ‘literary arts and its impact or inspiration on performing and visual arts’.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">All workshops conducted on campus at NAFA were livestreamed and a virtual campfire was held on Zoom. </p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">Crossings 2021 was a highly anticipated event for anyone interested in Singapore’s emerging talent and developing dance community. In 2021, the programme paid homage to Singapore’s contemporary dance scene through the works of Gillian Tan (Senior Lecturer, Dance, NAFA); Kenneth Tan (2013 Graduate, NAFA), Shahrin Johry (Dance Artist, Maya Dance Theatre) and Zhou Zihao (Associate Artist, T.H.E Dance Company and 2012 Young Artist Award recipient). The edge and versatility of NAFA’s conservatory-style trained dancers brought to fruition the works of these Singapore choreographers and was furthered featured in selected student choreographies and classwork.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">The production was performed in NAFA’s Lee Foundation Theatre with Safe Management Measures in place for a live audience and livestreamed to a virtual audience.</p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">Devised and performed by 12 multitalented Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Performance Making Year 2 students, <i>0.01</i> explores the collective loneliness and estrangement we are experiencing today and asks how the connection might play a part in our healing. The original production premiered at the 2022 M1 Singapore Fringe Festival and was co-directed by Rei Poh (Programme Leader, Mandarin Drama and Senior Lecturer, Theatre) and Goh Shou Yi (Adjunct Lecturer, Dance). </p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">The immersive performance received four out of five stars in a <a href="https://bakchormeeboy.com/2022/01/18/%e2%98%85%e2%98%85%e2%98%85%e2%98%85%e2%98%86-review-0-01-by-goh-shou-yi-rei-poh-nanyang-academy-of-fine-arts/" target="_blank">review</a> on Bakchormeeboy, an online platform dedicated to media coverage of the arts scene. Praising the performance, the review notes: “Facilitators Rei, Shou Yi, and dramaturg Zee Wong have brought out the best in this group. Not only have they conceptualised an ethereal performance that captures both the stress and beauty of urban living; they’ve also given each student a chance to play to their strengths, leading to precise movements from the dance students, and clear, emotive delivery from the theatre students.”</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">ArtsEquator reviewer Rebecca G. also <a href="https://artsequator.com/0-01-nafa-review/" target="_blank">noted</a> the ensemble’s cohesive performance: “The show is ultimately a celebration of a strong cast of performers, and a testament to the efforts of both co-creators and dramaturg Zee Wong in creating a space that enabled such a heartfelt sharing of experiences. Loneliness, distance, silence, comfort, and the stories in between — <i>0.01</i> invites the audience to take a closer look at what divides us, and to imagine what could happen when we cross that liminal boundary.”</p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">In their mission to advance art and education, the Woon Brothers Foundation has always generously supported the academy with awards to be presented to outstanding Fine Art diploma and degree graduates. The awards seek to nurture these young artists as well as recognise and promote promising talents.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft"><i>Tending Tenderness</i> is a homecoming exhibition organised by the Fine Art programme, which gathered six past award recipients—Ho Seok Kee, Kim Hyesu, Koh Kai Ting, Michelle Wong, Shairah Rohaizam and Wong Gin Ming—to honour the generosity of the Woon Brothers Foundation over the last six years. The artists featured created works across a range of mediums, materials and processes that reflected the concerns and preoccupations of this emerging generation of art practitioners. </p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">These emerging artists have had to adapt to adversity and shift modes of artmaking in an art ecosystem that has been profoundly impacted by the global pandemic, yet continues to quietly and resolutely exist. The narratives are tender and urgent and themes prevalent in their works include spaces of intimacy, invisible networks and microcosms, artificial intelligence, data and technology, identity and embodied memories, domestic soundscapes, and acts of remembering.</p>

Themed ‘Reunion’, the iconic street light-up brought festive cheer to the streets of Chinatown and paid tribute to how Singaporeans have stood together to overcome challenges brought about by the pandemic. The centrepiece of the display was a stunning 12-metre-tall statue of Chang-E, the Chinese goddess of the moon.</p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">In collaboration with Singapore Airlines (SIA), Year 3 Diploma in Design (Object and Jewellery) students worked on an upcycling project for their Final Year Project (FYP). Students designed and proposed object and wearable jewellery from materials and parts of a retired Airbus A380 aircraft. The design proposals were presented to a team from SIA comprising Joanne Toh, Design & Branding Manager and Xin Yu Tan, Senior Service Designer. Three works won top honours and five others were presented at The Grad Expectations 2022. The winning works are <i>LuMill Lighting</i> by Gwee Yu Fang, <i>Rowi Jewellery</i> by Chen Zheng Xin and <i>CUBIT Stool</i> by Raven Ashley.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">In addition, the arts and aviation industry converged in a live client project featuring the following creative brief from SIA—‘BRINGING THE SINGAPORE AIRLINES EXPERIENCE AT 30,000 FEET TO YOU: To enable our customers to reminisce their journey with us and inspire the public to dream about their next travel experience’.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">Students from all four Diploma in Fine Art classes were engaged across varying mediums and they operated both physically and conceptually within the framework of upcycling. After a period of ideation, students executed their ideas in the studio, breathing new life into the textile and metal-based inventory from SIA.</p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">Capping off the performance was an hour-long panel discussion with international medical practitioners and movement professionals congregating to discuss the importance of dance and movement for people with disabilities, the elderly, and those with Parkinson’s disease. The panel featured Dr Dominic Jamora (St. Luke’s Movement Disorders Service); Dr Jennifer Marie Yang (College of Arts & Social Sciences and College of Health & Medicine, Australian National University); and Novy Bereber (Bereber Sayaw PD).

The triple bill of three short plays, directed by acclaimed local directors, Rizman Putra and Ong Kian Sin, were presented by the Year 3 Diploma in Theatre (English Drama) and Diploma in Theatre (Mandarin Drama) students. </p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">The collaboration offered students a valuable opportunity to work in a professional setting and perform to public audiences. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these performances were presented to a reduced capacity audience and shared online after the live performances had ended.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">The new plays were written by three ethnic minority female writers and were developed under Teater Ekamatra’s Playwrights Development Programme. The showcase aimed to highlight the talent of NAFA students as they deftly tackled complex themes such as mortality, loss and solitude on stage.</p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">An important review of the Royal College of Music (RCM)-NAFA Bachelor of Music (Honours) programme is carried out every five years to align the strategies of the two institutions, and plan future development. In March 2022, the review was conducted by a panel from the RCM—comprising Kevin Porter (Deputy Director), Diana Salazar (Director of Programmes), Vanessa Latarche (Head of Keyboard & Associate Director for Partnerships in China), and Elly Taylor (Academic Registrar). Apart from ensuring overall quality and developing the programme to meet evolving academic and artistic standards, the Review Panel also validated the new postgraduate programmes. </p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">As part of collaborative staff development, Salazar gave two presentations, titled ‘Educational Leadership in the Conservatoire’ and ‘Faculty Research Series XVI: Towards Digital Artistry: Digital Opportunities in Higher Music Education’ to the NAFA academic staff on 29 March at Interval @Library. Degree students studying the Musician in the Digital Age module also had the opportunity to attend the second presentation to learn about harnessing technology to learn music.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">Over the span of a decade, the successful partnership between NAFA and RCM has seen more than 200 NAFA students graduate from the degree programme.</p>

             <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">The second iteration of the Southeast Asian Arts Forum—Schoolhouse Mavericks—was a hybrid forum that included both in-person and livestreamed presentations, performances and dialogues. The goal was to inspire practice-led teaching and learning of Southeast Asian arts by facilitating an exchange between the community and the classroom. </p>
             <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">The speakers featured in this forum are mavericks in their field and unconventional thinkers from a diverse background of creative and academic disciplines. With the aid of technology, travel restrictions and other limitations caused by the pandemic did not stop the 32 creators and makers located in eight different cities across Southeast Asia from coming together to share their thoughts and experiences. Over three days, several hundred people online and in the live venues were able to participate in the dialogues about how to collaborate, teach and learn in such unprecedented times, as well as how to adapt to keep the arts and the spirits of creators vital and alive.</p>
             <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">Inspiration abounded as techniques were revisited, and discussion was lively on new methodologies that had developed and surfaced across the arts and in the livelihoods of craftsmen and communities—opening our eyes to a Southeast Asian world that is steeped in tradition but ever evolving.</p>

For the third year running, students from different disciplines presented performances and outcomes from the modules inspired by research into Ayutthaya’s history.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">Gamelan musicians from the NAFA Music Programme, led by Alicia de Silva (Programme Leader and Lecturer, Office of Academic Affairs), performed <i>Ladrang Perang</i> and <i>Dancing Shadows in the Temple</i>, the latter being the denouement of the evening. The piece was inspired by the ruins of Ayutthaya and Nang Yai (Thai shadow play), and featured fragmentary motifs performed on the gamelan instruments as well as the guzheng. The blend of sounds sought to capture the different facets of Ayutthaya’s past, and played the role of a storyteller transporting their audience’s imagination to the actual ruins of the historic city itself.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">Students of the Dance Programme performed three pieces titled <i>Kritda Phinihan, Ton Vorachet</i> and <i>Sat Chatri</i>. The English Drama and Mandarin Drama theatre students each put up a captivating performance.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">With the exhibition <i>Flagship Genius</i>—featuring works by NAFA’s brightest artistic talents—sharing space with <i>Ayutthaya</i>; the entire event celebrated the works of students past and present, and served as a testament to the academy’s mission to promote learning and growth through the arts.</p>

As part of their growth of becoming culturally aware creators, the students acquired not only technical knowledge, but also learnt about the historical narrative and cultural significance of these artistic practices.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight"><b>Ramwong Mattathan Thai Dance Workshop with Absolutely Thai by Kansadaeng Watthanatham</b><br/> As part of the <i>Ayutthaya</i> project, students were taught the Sat Chatri dance, which is derived from <i>Lakhon Chatri</i>—one of Thailand’s oldest extant dance dramas that originated during the Ayutthaya period. The students performed the Sat Chatri to a live audience at the opening of <i>Flagship Genius featuring Ayutthaya III</i>.</p>

The lessons combined theory and practice, and included a field trip to Sri Warisan—Singapore’s first fully professional Malay dance company—for Year 2 students. These culminated in dance presentations that incorporated Silat movements. </p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">Through the workshop, students learnt to transfer basic dance movement principles and concepts across dance forms, all while developing keener kinaesthetic awareness, movement efficiency and safe practices in dances.</p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">Tay's obsession with marine biodiversity and ecology has long fueled his imagination and inspired the expressive vocabulary of his art. This exhibition was his tribute to marine life—a subject not commonly explored in Chinese ink painting.  </p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">Tay's free, playful and dynamic work which is steeped in artistic heritage and tradition embodies NAFA’s pioneering spirit of exploration.</p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">A 360-degree view of the exhibition with commentary was made available to NAFA students and audiences worldwide.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">In conjunction with this exhibition, the eighth instalment of the Southeast Asian Art Clinic explored the theme of storytelling in artmaking through the eyes of the artists. The two-part series consisted of a forum discussion and live dialogue session with selected students from the School of Art & Design (SOAD) discussing works from the exhibition and sharing their reflections online through soundtracks, collages and objects. The sharing session was an enhanced opportunity for peer learning and an exchange of new ideas.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">ISEAA facilitated an in-curricular collaboration with SOAD, with close to 500 students from the NAFA Foundation Programme attending the General Studies module online. This was the first time the module was adapted for online delivery and was very well received by the students and faculty. Live guided tours were conducted by ISEAA staff who also hosted livestreamed discussions with the artists over several sessions. Boudville presented her work in person at the gallery.</p>

Nine authors worked with the co-editors Associate Professor Joyce Koh Hwee Ling (University of Otago) and Dr Rebecca Kan (Vice Dean, Pedagogy and Research, NAFA) to create a nuanced view of their practices in technology-enhanced learning, capturing the educational and performative contexts of our time. </p>
                      <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">The publication was launched on 4 March 2022, and the online event was graced by Mrs Tan-Soh Wai Lan (President, NAFA) and Professor Helen Nicholson (Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Academic, University of Otago). The launch featured a keynote by Associate Professor Koh; a visual conversation between Georgette Yu and Jacinta Freeman; video abstracts about products in design presented by Tan Choong Kheng and Winson Ho; a panel discussion with Alicia de Silva, Gillian Tan and Grace Leong; and concluded with an open discussion with all the authors, moderated by Dr Kan. The impactful programme provided key insights into unique and established pedagogies by the NAFA faculty members, the effectiveness of which paved the way for more research-informed teaching and learning through the arts.</p>

                      <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">NAFA’s first exposition on artistic research ran as an online discourse over three days in August 2021. The seminars showcased how NAFA’s artist-educators drew upon their personal experiences in the arts to question, ponder and theorise new possibilities. Their artmaking processes were seen as acts of research grounded in text. By focusing on the relationship between creating art and articulating their encounters, the NAFA faculty was setting out a way to explore diverse inquiries in greater depth by weaving artistic practice with reflective pedagogical and research considerations.</p>
                      <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">The 10 NAFA artist-educators across the performing arts and visual arts were engaged in projects that demonstrated a wide range of performative, visual and theoretical dimensions. The practice-based research inquiry evoked the multiple identities of artist, researcher and teacher that NAFA practitioners occupy.</p>

                      <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">NAFA’s third annual edition of Research in Education and Arts Practice (REAP) was released in January 2022 and served as a space for practitioners to reflect on the challenging circumstances experienced in teaching and learning during the second year of COVID-19. The publication <i>Living in Liminality</i> celebrates liminars who were not afraid to engage in new ideas, practices and innovations in arts education and practice research. </p>
                      <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">In the issue, contributors explored how technology could enhance the education of artists and designers, and how NAFA had seeded a culture of research in processes that supports research and professional learning. International partners from New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom were also featured. </p>
                      <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">The final chapter includes a closing note from Mrs Tan-Soh Wai Lan (President, NAFA), who highlighted the importance of artistic research and the progression of the academy’s practice-oriented research efforts.</p>

             <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">Sculpture Society (Singapore) (SSS) is the first society in Singapore dedicated to nurturing a public appreciation of sculpture as an art form. The society counts many outstanding NAFA alumni among its members and academy graduates of recent years continue to join the society’s ranks; bringing new perspectives in the realm of sculpture.</p>
             <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">To cultivate the spirit of inquiry in young practitioners of three-dimensional art, a year-long mentorship was run by distinguished sculptor Yeo Chee Kiong and academic Tan Yen Peng through this platform. Both esteemed artist-educators are NAFA alumni and key members of the SSS. Over 12 months, six young artists were encouraged to develop critical perspectives in visual art practice, with an emphasis on sculpture and three-dimensional art within the context of local and Southeast Asian art scenes. This process expanded the young artists’ understanding of theory and practice.</p>
             <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInRight">The mentorship continued through the pandemic and young artists based overseas continued to keep in touch with their mentors online. The sustained interactions the six mentees had with Yeo and Tan culminated in works produced and presented at <i>reTHINGing Materiality - Contemporary Sculpture 2021.</i> More than 30 artworks by NAFA alumni and SSS members of figurative and abstract sculptures, ceramics, installations and new media art were exhibited.</p>

                      <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">How can an educational institution help our young graduates navigate the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic? What can help young graduates recalibrate their compass to find opportunities that have arisen from this crisis?</p>
                      <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">Envisioning a Post-Pandemic Future is a 10-week research project that involved three mentors and seven students from different disciplines. The project’s aim was to equip our students with the knowledge to make better decisions as they set sail in the untested waters of a post-pandemic future. Carried out during a period when there were restrictions on in-person gatherings and strict safe distancing guidelines, this undertaking was also a model on exploiting opportunities in crisis.</p>
                      <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">The research dived deep into five emerging trends—The Museum Experience, The Theatre Experience, New Hospitality Experiences, New Retail Experiences and Sustainability in Food Delivery Systems—to reveal opportunity areas for designers and the skills students can master to remain relevant.</p>
                      <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">In 2021, in collaboration with CapitaLand malls, the research reached other communities when it was presented in a roving exhibition between five major shopping malls downtown and in the heartlands.</p>

The theme of the project was a reminder to take a break from the busyness of life, and to unwind and reconnect with loved ones. In this inaugural partnership with interior design studio White Jacket, the stools were available for purchase through a silent auction. Proceeds go towards the NAFA Education Fund and International Fund for Animal Welfare.</p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">This cross-institution collaboration initiated by the National Museum of Singapore (NMS) brought together six students from NAFA and the National University of Singapore’s Division of Industrial Design. Students from both institutions had to design an installation based on stories about the Bras Basah Bugis precinct and NMS, which was to be displayed at the Singapore Night Festival (SNF). Although SNF was cancelled in 2021 due to prevailing pandemic restrictions, the installation was available for viewing at the Gallery Theatre of NMS at SNF 2022. </p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">Two mentors—award-winning designer Wendy Chua and established theatre practitioner Koh Hui Ling—led the students through a series of workshops and fieldwork. Chua’s and Koh’s different creative backgrounds gave all participants an opportunity to learn techniques outside of their discipline. Participants were also introduced to a series of design phases, namely site-sensing, ideation, sound and experience design, participatory theatre methods, and design for implementation.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">The resulting showcase interweaves open design with theatre dramaturgy. </p>

The work is designed such that the sunlight of the summer in the day will glorify the Horse Sculpture and its kaleidoscope-like mirror finished surface, while at night, the projected light on the surrounding ground will turn the sculpture into a beacon of hope.</p>

The exhibition interrogated socially and culturally defined frameworks of femininity in a quiet provocation of desire, power, intimacy, and personal agency through the artists' long-term explorations—Gupta's <i>Production of Desire</i> and Chen's <i>Stories of a woman and her dowry</i>. Both works navigate the precarities of the cultural tropes and expectations of Asian women, in a palpable reclamation of tenderness and strength embedded in the feminine narrative and identity. The Objectifs Chapel Gallery was transformed by the incisive installations into a space that was visceral and contemplative as symbolic gestures, rituals and objects were employed in ways that were equally autonarrative and somatic—unpacking the underlying performativity of being a woman. </p>

              <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">To express our heartfelt gratitude and appreciation, and to deepen the relationship between our donors and students, NAFA organised a Japanese Pastel Nagomi Art Workshop which was held on 3 December 2021. The donors who attended were each joined by one of their scholarship recipients.</p>
              <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">Seated in a classroom, our donors reminisced about their times as students as they tried their hand at this art form involving techniques such as blending and reduction. It was heartwarming to see the students chatting away and interacting with their benefactors over a shared interest in the arts. Both the donors and our students thoroughly enjoyed the session and looked forward to more arts-related workshops.</p>

             <p class="large wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">When you donate to NAFA, your donation will be used to support our scholarly initiatives and build the academy’s capabilities. More importantly, your donation is a message of encouragement for the creative pursuits of our students and faculty, and the staff who support them. It is a statement that you believe in nurturing artistic growth. </p>
             <p class="large wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">One in every four students is in need of financial support and can benefit tremendously from your donation, no matter the amount.</p>

             <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">Following Mr and Mrs Christopher Ho’s generous donations in 2019 of S$100,000 to organise the NAFA School of Young Talents—Christopher and Rosy Ho Music Competition, and S$150,000 in 2020 for the purchase of a Steinway grand piano, the Junior Music Department received another donation of S$230,000 in December 2021. </p>
             <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft">Part of 2021's contribution has gone towards the purchase of another Steinway piano, and a part has been set aside for full scholarships to be awarded to outstanding Junior Music students from 2022 to 2024. In appreciation of the donation, another studio accommodating the second Steinway piano has been named the Rose Recording Studio.</p>

                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">After its resounding success in 2020, the Scholars Give Back Series returned for the second time in 2021. In the Fashion x Fine Art edition, the NAFA Fashion Studies alumni scholars were provided with an opportunity to pay it forward by using their talent to produce items inspired by the works of distinguished fine artists, with their creations sold to raise funds for the NAFA Education Fund.</p>
                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">Three NAFA alumni who had benefited from the Fund mentored the current scholars in this meaningful project. The mentors are award-winning fashion designers Max Tan, Jeremy Jiang Yong Joon and Xie Qianqian. Funds were raised through giving.sg and donors received the works of these teams as tokens of appreciation.</p>

        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
