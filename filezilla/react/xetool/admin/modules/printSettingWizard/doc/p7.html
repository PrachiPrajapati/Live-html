                    <li>In the new page, go to <b>Price Settings</b>.</li>
                    <li>Under price settings, find <b>Setup Cost</b> and enable it.</li>
                    <li> Give desired setup price in the box that appears below.<img src="modules/printSettingWizard/doc/assets/p7_1.png" /></li>
                    <li>Click <b>Save</b>.</li>
                </ol>
                Setup price is enabled now.<br>
                <br>
                There are different condition for setting up the Setup Cost :
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If "Per Product Side" is Enable then the price will be added for each side that has been customized.<img src="modules/printSettingWizard/doc/assets/p7_2.png" />
                        Example :<br>
                        The setup price is set as $5 and number of sides customized is 2. Then $5 will get multiplied by 2 and that will give to $10 ($5 x 2= $10). So the Setup Cost is $10 which will be added to the total printing cost. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If "Per Product" is Enable then the price will be added only once independent of number of sides customized.<img src="modules/printSettingWizard/doc/assets/p7_3.png" />
                        Example :<br>
                        The setup price is set as $5 and number of sides customized is 4. Only $5 will get calculated to the total printing cost.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If "Single Order" is Enable then price will be added to each item in order. That means total number of order will get multiplied with the Setup Cost.<img src="modules/printSettingWizard/doc/assets/p7_4.png" />
                        Example :<br>
                        The setup price is set as $5 and there is 50 items in order. Then $5 will get multiplied with 50 and that will results to $250 ($5 x 50 = 250). So the Setup Cost is $250 which will be added to the total printing cost.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If "Multiple order" is Enable then price will be added to the total number of order amount.<img src="modules/printSettingWizard/doc/assets/p7_5.png" />
